# U2.W4: Technical Blog Entry

## Learning Competencies
- Research a public ruby method and identify a scenario it could be used in
- Explain how to use an existing ruby method
<br> **OR**
- Compare different programming concepts
- Explain a methodology for deciding which data structure/ loop/ or language to use in a particular scenario


## Release 0: New file
Copy your blog tempate into a new HTML file named `week4_technical.html`. 


## Release 1: Research a Topic
### Option 1: Teach about Enumerable Methods
Select one of the ruby methods below, do some research on it, and think of a scenario that could teach how to use this method. Then write a blog that explains how it works (and what it works on) using that scenario. Be sure to include samples of code in your blog! It's good for people to see what you are talking about. 

#### Topics
- `Enumerable#map`

- `Enumerable#group_by`
Converts a group or array into a hash of arrays according to the given block

- `Enumerable#cycle`
Similiar to a FOR loop, cycle runs a block against an Array forever, or a preset number of times if a number is passed.


### Option 2: Research Questions
Research one of the following questions/topics. In your blog post, you will want to explain the background and teach others how to implement what you've learned. 

- Arrays vs. Hashes. What are they? What are they good for? How do you know which one to use? (Teach others a strategy for deciding)
- Looping - Discuss the various ways to loop in Ruby. How can you decide which is best to use? (Teach others a strategy for deciding)
Top 3 Ruby Developer Goals
Functionality
Fast Development
Readable + Maintainable Code

What is not a major goal?  Speed.

Yes, speed is important.  As programmers, we should keep in mind that certain methods take longer than others.  However, don't sweat it too much.  Execution speed is for the C++ people.  After the program is created, we can look back and see where the bottlenecks appear in our code.  Rather than spending hours upfront on something that might not even matter, lets focus on keeping our code legible.

When it comes to looping, Ruby has a bunch of different ways to tackle the problem, so how do we determine the right way to do it?  <b>Readable + Maintainable Code</b>.  

If you spend too much time testing each method for speed, your goal of <b>Fast Development</b> will suffer.  Write your code, determine if it functions properly, and refactor if it will be hard for another programmer to read.

<h3>For Loops...</h3>
<p>For loops are the way to go when you need to do something a specific number of times.  Examples include


- Ruby vs. JavaScript - Discuss the benefits/drawbacks of each as you've experienced them. Explain to others how to decide which is better to use for what. 
  Also include examples of how to do the same thing in each. 

If you want to go more in-depth with any of these research memory use and link it to your strategy for deciding which to use. 

Write this blog for an audience of newb programmers.


## Release 2: Publish
Link to your blog on the index of your site and push your changes. 

Make sure the index of your site is maintained, nice, and professional. This is your face in the online community, so make it nice!

## Release 3: Share!

Share your blog on the google+ community under "Blog Posts!" Read others and see if you agree or disagree. Start a discussion on this topic.  Consider sharing your blog post on Reddit as well.
