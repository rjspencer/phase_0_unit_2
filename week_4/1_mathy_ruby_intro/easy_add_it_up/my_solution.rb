# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
/*
Create total() method.
Input an array of numbers.
  >Create a variable sum set to 0.
  >Loop through the array.
