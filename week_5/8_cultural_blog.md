## Release 1: Research
Research about some of the problems facing the tech world. Select one. 

Outsourcing

As the world gets smaller, it also becomes more competitive.  Once upon a time, local stores were the only game in town and people had to shop there.  Today, travel is easier, cheaper and there are countless online retailers that can have your goods delivered in a few days.  In many ways, this is better for the consumer, especially when it comes to prices.

The world of technology services is globalizing.  Designers, developers, and other IT employees are facing competition from across the planet.  It costs lot less to live in India than it does to live in Chicago and therefore can work for lower wages.  Freelancing websites such as Elance.com and Freelancer.com make it easy for customers to find low cost IT workers.

These people are taking our jobs, what do we do?  Accept it.  If you lived in a 3rd-world country and had the opportunity to become a freelancer for a rich american company, you would do it too.  

American IT workers need to make sure the higher wages they demand result in a product that is worth the cost.  We need to know more, build better, and interact more.  Face to face interactions with clients and understanding the American market are two things developers from other nations can not match.
